    <p>
      Revolutions happened and happening w/t time need to be understud. cause u
      will understand a lot about society or how people act/behave in
      society,how do they work, what things makes them happy and so far .. and
      if u pay little more attention and put these revolutions on single
      timeline u'll found that how people cnaged their philosophy of life
      w/time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agricultural revolution which happened first time bring down the
      people to settle on one place and forced to live in groups.Before this
      people mostly hunt for food, move from one place to another.they never
      think of setteling down at one place they have to move for hunting which
      is the only source of food. We can still find these type of people in
      small villages where they came and go. then this revolution thigs changes
      alot.People started to living in groups, in a structured societies and
      making communities. W/this rise of agriculture, communities started to
      cultivet the crop and domestic animals,leading to constant supply of food
      and increase the permenant settlement.This shift from nomadic lifestyle to
      settled agriculture laid down the complex architecture of societies.

      Now this is time When socil power,social status are taking roots
      drastically...then this Industrial revolution which is most transformotive
      period in human history is happened.The change is so powerful that it
      creates lot of threats for people other than its Golden
      inventions.Everyone agree that the machinaries we see today are changed
      the people's livin standard and makes a lot easy.But if u see the other
      part its a base for complex social issues such as large wealth
      inquality,social power imbalance.Basically, this revolution made people to
      think that taking hands on the machinaries will give u the wealth and
      indirectoly power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now real game started from here .. we(The earths ) have resources and we
      will build efficient machinaries(to create goods from resources) so the
      only things we need are workers and consumers(customers to buy goods).With
      the use of inventions happened in this revolution efficient machinaries
      were build and it created lot of jobs this is a good point but most of
      them are soul saping jobs means u dont need to involve fully just give ur
      8 hours so u can get paid at the end.These work are so boring that workers
      not motivated for it.From here the promotion,Bonus and Retirement concept
      are created which kills the joy of life.The work-life balance philosophy
      which is total myth is comming from this industrial revolution.Such
      philosophy created by few peoples to keep people(who are workers) on there
      jobs and to keep machinaries in work.So the large amount of goods can be
      produced which will later distributed to consumer and this process helps
      to create larger wealth and ultimately power.Consumer culture and cheap
      entertenment where getting increased.Leaders started to use the cheap kind
      of plessure on worker to keep the feactories working to produce the good.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the inventions whether its scitific,technological or other from this
      revolution are now used to create power and wealth... if everyone seeking
      for power then how wars will not happens and thats what we the weapens are
      also get modernized in this period by using machinaries.Now this
      revolution's second part is technological one which has little bit more
      advanced version of invention such as aeroplanes and who will forget that
      <b>manhatten project</b> about creating the first atomic bomb which laid
      the word in hell and again these inventions such plane,telephone,mobile
      change people lives but they fully utilised in wars for power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason behind of understing the revolutions and these patterns tell
      lot about current one.. Now we are in software revolution and we are
      seeing lot of current invention and breackthorugh happening right now.Like
      what happened in past revolutions we know we used all the invention
      intellectully in building weapens to take position in wars and the nature
      of wars is ultimately depends on the ongoing invenstions of revolutions as
      discused above.
    </p>
    <p>
      War is the human mind's tendency and also it always evolving something
      which means we can't stops these inventions or technological
      developement.In this software revolution the information/data is most
      important ones.. kind of fuel of software..point is now we cannot expect
      nuclear weapens getting used in wars not a signle country will do
      that..cause if we see past's pattern...at industrial revolution,
      machinaries such as guns,tanks are used in wars insted of hand axes(& many
      other).similarly, in technological revolution we used bombs and planes
      which are developed in this revolution itself and are the breackthroughs.
      so similarly in this sofware revolution the weapens will be of sofware
      inventions.For prediction perpose we can say the wars now involved w/t AI
      and synthetic biology.Because these areas are getting evolved rappidly
      these days. ..if someone want to kill you he will not use gun/bomb now he
      will feed u w/the wrong kind of information or data and u r gone!.also
      that one virus will show u the end....cause u cant use past weapens as
      every one racing towards power and only current invenstions will give
      that...so they get used in wars. upcomming wars are not of atomic bomb
      forget them...now we will going to see information(intelligence) involved
      wars.The data will become assets in future. Someone can develope a Bad AI
      or may be a create virus while seating in lab.
