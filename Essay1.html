    <h2 class="titleCSS">The revolutions & patterns</h2>
    <p>
      i think revolutions happened and happening w/t time need to be understud. cause u will understand a lot about society or how people act/behave in society,how do they work, what things makes them happy and
      so far.. and if u pay little more attention and put these revolutions on single timeline u'll found that how people's philosophy of life changes w/time.

    <p>
      The agricultural revolution which happened first time which bring down people to settle on one place,live in groups.Before this people live on hunting, move from one place to another.they never think of setteling down at one place they have to move for hunting for food.We can still find these type of people in small villages where they came and go after
      living..then this revolution thigs changes alot.People started to living in groups, in a structured societies and making communities. W/this rise
      of agriculture, communities started to cultivet the crop and domestic animals,leading to constant supply of food and increase the permenant settlement.This shift from nomadic lifestyle to settled agriculture laid down the complex architecture of societies.

      Now this is time When socil power,social status are taking roots drastically...then this Industrial revolution which is most transformotive period in human history is happened.The change is so powerful that it creates lot of threats for people other than its Golden inventions.Everyone agree that the machinaries we see today are changed the people's livin standard and makes a lot easy.But if u see the other part its a base for complex social issues such as large wealth inquality,social power imbalance.Basically, this revolution made people to think that taking hands on the machinaries will give u the wealth and indirectoly power.
    
      Now real game started from here .. we(The earths ) have resources and we will build efficient machinaries(to create goods from resources) so the only things we need are workers and consumers(customers to buy goods).With the use of inventions happened in this revolution efficient machinaries were build and it created lot of jobs this is a good point but most of
      them are sole saping jobs means u dont need to involve fully just give ur 8 hours so u get paid at the end.The work-life balance philosophy which is
      total myth is comming from this industrial revolution.Such philosophy created by few peoples to keep people(who are workers) on there jobs and to keep machinaries in work.So the large amount of goods can be produced which will later distributed to consumer and this process helps to create larger wealth and ultimately power.Consumer culture and cheap entertenment where getting increased.

      This revolution's all the inventions are now used to create power..we also see that the weapens are also get modernized in this period.Now this revolution's second part is technological one which has little bit more advanced version of invention such as aeroplanes and who will forget that manhatten project about creating the first atomic bomb which laid the word
      in hell and again these inventions such plane,telephone,mobile change people lives but takes also other part they fully utilised in war for power.

      The reason behind of understing the revolutions and these patterns tell lot about current one.. Now we are in software revolution and we will seeing lot of current invention and breackthorugh happening right now.Like what happened in past revolutions we know we used all the invention intellectully in building weapens to take position in wars and the nature of wars will depends on the current invenstions of revolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      War is the tendency of human mind and also mind never stops evolution which means we can stops these inventions or technological developement.In this software revolution the information/data is most important ones.its the fuel of software..point is now we cannot expect nuclear weapens war not signle country will do that..cause at industrial revolution times machinaries such as guns are used in wars insted of hand axes(& many other) in technological revolution we used bombs and little machines so similarly in this sofware revolution the weapens will be of sofware inventions...if someone want to kill you he will not use gun/bomb now he will feed u w/the wrong kind of information or date and u r gone....cause only current invenstions will give u wealth and hence power...so they get used in wars.So upcomming wars are not of atomic bomb forget them...now we will going to see information(intelligence) involved wars.The data will become assets
