  i think revolutions  happened or happening on a line of time need to be understud. cause these onese decide a lot about society or change how people act/behave in society,how do they work, what things makes them happy and so far.. and if u pay little more attention and put these revolutions on single timeline u'll found that how peoples life philosophy changes w/time and u will also notice one thing that how  
  the agricultural revolution which happened first time which bring down people to settle on one place,live in groups.Before this people live on hunting, move from one place to another.
  Never think of setteling down at one place they just movable.we can still find these type of people in small villages where they came and go after living....then this revolution changes alot and people started to living in groups, in a structured societies and making communities.W/this rise of  agriculture,communities started to cultivet the crop and domestic animals,leading to  constand supply of food and increase the permenant settlement.This shift from nomadic lifestyle to settled agriculture laid down the complex architecture of societies.
  Now this is time where socil power,social status are  taking roots drastically...then this Industrial revolution which is most transformotive period in human history.
