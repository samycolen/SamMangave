        Developed a dynamic Spring Boot application as part
        of the <strong>CodeSync</strong> project. The current focus involves the
        implementation of a user login system using
        <strong>Spring MVC</strong> controllers, with dedicated endpoints for
        login page rendering and processing. Then its delved into
        potential enhancements, considering the integration of security
        features, including the utilization of the
        <strong>WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter</strong> class for a more robust
        authentication mechanism. As the project progresses, exploring
        <strong>Spring Security</strong> concepts, such as user authentication,
        authorization, and endpoint security, is anticipated to ensure the
        development of a secure and well-architected application.
